#These files were part of a project examining the attributes of certificate programs for adults vs. traditional 
#education such as college. It looks like there are more adults getting vocational certifications than college 
#degrees, that there are more women getting all types of higher education than men, and that most programs are in 
#the east coast of the country including the Great Lakes area. In addition, at least half of certificate programs 
#are tech related.
